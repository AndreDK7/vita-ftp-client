# vita-ftp-client
Simple FTP Client App for Vita

![Preview](/screenshot/preview.jpg)

# Requirements
The app is built with imgui-vita which needs the **libshacccg.suprx** extracted. If you are experiencing a crash after upgrading to 1.21. Please follow the following guide to get that extracted.

As of v1.30 the app will no longer crash, but display a message that you are missing the libshacccg.suprx files.

# Know Issues
Opening the Input Editor multiple times crashes the application. I can't figure out what's wrong. If somebody knows what's the problem. Help me out.
